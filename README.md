# UX Internship Repository (`cs-under-ux`)

During my 8th semester, I joined an online internship officially titled as a **UX Design Internship**. While it was meant to focus on user experience, most of the content felt more like **computer science fundamentals**—covering programming basics, logic, and structured problem-solving.

The mismatch between the advertised UX theme and the actual content inspired the name of this repository: **`cs-under-ux`**. A playful way to acknowledge that, under the UX label, it was largely a CS crash course.

This repository contains all official materials, my structured notes, module summaries, booklet versions, and a compiled book.
