## 1. What an Array Is

* An **array** is a data structure that stores a **collection of elements of the same data type**.
* Elements are stored in **contiguous memory locations**.
* All elements are accessed using:

  * one variable name
  * an **index** to identify each element
* Arrays are **homogeneous** (same data type).

---

## 2. Why Arrays Are Needed

* Managing large collections of data (e.g., 1000 values) using individual variables is:

  * inefficient
  * unreadable
  * wasteful
* Arrays allow:

  * compact code
  * loop-based processing
  * scalable data handling
* Arrays are foundational to:

  * searching algorithms
  * sorting algorithms
  * stacks, queues, hash tables, linked lists
  * strings
  * databases
  * graphics and mathematical models

---

## 3. Historical Context (Conceptual)

* Early arrays were implemented via:

  * self-modifying code
  * memory segmentation
* Modern high-level languages provide native array support
* CPUs are often optimized for array operations

---

## 4. Array Declaration Methods

### Method 1: Declare and initialize

```c
int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

* Compiler infers array size.

### Method 2: Declare with size, initialize later

```c
int a[10];
```

* Elements assigned at runtime (input, computation, file I/O).

---

## 5. Array Size Rules

* Size must be specified at compile time (except VLAs).
* Size **cannot be changed after compilation**.
* From C99 onward:

  * **Variable Length Arrays (VLA)** are supported.
* Over-allocating wastes memory.

---

## 6. Indexing Rules

* Array indices start at **0**.
* Valid indices:

  * `0` to `size - 1`
* Accessing out-of-bounds indices:

  * causes undefined behavior
  * may not be caught at compile time
  * often leads to runtime bugs

---

## 7. Arrays and Memory

* Arrays occupy **contiguous memory**.
* Memory usage = `size × sizeof(data_type)`
* Example:

  * `int ages[14];`
  * If `sizeof(int) = 4 bytes`, total = `56 bytes`
* Efficient access due to predictable memory layout.

---

## 8. Using Loops with Arrays

* **for-loops** are the primary tool for array traversal.
* Common pattern:

  * iterate from `0` to `size - 1`
* Allows:

  * sequential access
  * bulk operations
  * scalable logic

---

## 9. Assigning and Accessing Elements

* Assign using index:

```c
ages[5] = 21;
```

* Random access is allowed (not just sequential).
* Arithmetic and logical operations work the same as with normal variables.

---

## 10. Common Array Errors

* Incorrect index calculations
* Mixing loop bounds
* Off-by-one errors
* Using uninitialized arrays
* Runtime errors instead of compile-time errors
* Most array bugs come from **index misuse**

---

## 11. Arithmetic Operations on Arrays

* Element-wise operations using loops:

  * addition
  * subtraction
  * multiplication
  * division
  * modulus
* Data type choice matters:

  * `int` division loses fractional part
  * Use `float` arrays for division results

---

## 12. Example Pattern (Two Arrays)

* Read values into arrays A and B
* Perform operations element-wise
* Store results in separate arrays
* Display results in tabular format

---

## 13. Logical Operations on Arrays

* Logical checks can be applied per element
* Index correctness is critical
* Useful for:

  * filtering data
  * condition-based processing

---

## 14. Strings as Arrays

* In C, a **string is a character array**.
* Ends with a **null terminator** `'\0'`.
* Syntax:

```c
char name[20];
```

* Each element occupies **1 byte**.

---

## 15. String Initialization Methods

1. Using string literal:

```c
char s[] = "Hello";
```

2. Specify size:

```c
char s[10] = "Hello";
```

3. Character-by-character:

```c
char s[] = {'H','e','l','l','o','\0'};
```

4. Character-by-character with size specified

⚠️ `'\0'` **must** be included when manually initializing.

---

## 16. Reading Strings with scanf

* `%s` stops at whitespace.
* Cannot read full names with spaces.
* Solution: **edit set conversion**

```c
scanf("%[^\n]", name);
```

* Reads until newline.

---

## 17. `string.h` Header File

Provides utilities for string manipulation:

* Reduces manual errors
* Must be included explicitly
* Header files should be explored before use

---

## 18. Common String Functions (Core)

* `strcat()` → concatenate strings
* `strncat()` → concatenate first `n` characters
* `strcmp()` → compare strings
* `strncmp()` → compare first `n` characters
* `strcpy()` → copy string
* `strncpy()` → copy first `n` characters
* `strlen()` → length excluding `'\0'`
* `strchr()` → first occurrence of character
* `strrchr()` → last occurrence of character

---

## 19. String Safety Concerns

* Many string functions:

  * lack bounds checking
  * fail silently
* Buffer overflows can:

  * crash programs
  * be exploited for attacks
* Prefer:

  * correct sizing
  * bounded versions (`strncpy`, `strncat`)
* Extra unused space is safer than overflow

---

## 20. Multi-Dimensional Arrays

* Arrays can have multiple dimensions.
* A **2D array** represents:

  * rows × columns (table)

```c
int a[rows][cols];
```

* First index → row
* Second index → column

---

## 21. Higher-Dimensional Arrays

* 3D and beyond supported:

```c
int a[x][y][z];
```

* Used in:

  * graphics
  * simulations
  * mathematical modeling
  * 3D data representation

---

## 22. Two-Dimensional Array Access

* Requires **nested loops**:

  * outer loop → rows
  * inner loop → columns
* Enables structured data processing

---

## 23. Demo: Multiplication Table

* Uses:

  * 2D array
  * nested loops
* Stores multiplication results
* Displays formatted table
* Demonstrates:

  * real-world array usage
  * separation of computation and display

---

## 24. Key Things to Remember (Checklist)

* Arrays store homogeneous data
* Indexing starts at zero
* Out-of-bounds access is dangerous
* Arrays occupy contiguous memory
* Size must match actual usage
* Loops are essential for arrays
* Strings are character arrays
* `'\0'` terminator is mandatory
* String functions require caution
* Most array bugs are logic bugs, not syntax errors
* Multi-dimensional arrays model structured data naturally
