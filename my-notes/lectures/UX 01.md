## 1. What Computer Science *Actually* Is

**Computer Science (CS)**
→ The study of **computational systems**
→ How problems are **modeled**, **solved**, and **automated** using computers

### Core idea

* Computers don’t “think” like humans
* They **follow logic and instructions**
* CS teaches us **how to design those instructions**

### Reality vs theory

* **On paper**: Theory → Development → Deployment
* **In practice**: Continuous improvement, updates, optimization

> Every update on your phone is computer science in motion.

## 2. Why Computer Science Matters

### Key advantages of computers

1. **Automation**

   * Repetitive tasks handled instantly
   * Example: billing, payroll, checkout systems

2. **Speed**

   * Massive computations done in seconds
   * Searching the internet vs manual lookup

3. **Accuracy**

   * Eliminates human fatigue errors
   * Caveat: **Garbage In → Garbage Out**

4. **Scalability**

   * One system can serve millions simultaneously

## 3. Core Terminology (You’ll See These Forever)

### Programming

* Designing **instructions** a computer can follow

### Coding

* Writing those instructions in **specific languages**

### Programming Language

* A formal system for communicating with computers
