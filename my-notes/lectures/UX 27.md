## 1. Why Agile Was Needed (Problem with Waterfall)

1. **Rigidity**

   * Changes after project start were extremely costly.
   * Requirements fixed too early.

2. **Long Development Cycles**

   * Software projects could last years.
   * By completion, technology and business needs had already changed.

3. **Late Feedback**

   * Customers saw the product only near the end.
   * High risk of building the *wrong* product.

4. **High Failure Rate**

   * Many projects were cancelled mid-way as they no longer met business needs.

## 2. Core Idea Behind Agile

1. **Expect Change, Don’t Fight It**
2. **Deliver Early and Frequently**
3. **Customer Involvement Throughout**
4. **Working Software Over Heavy Documentation**
5. **Iterative and Incremental Development**

Agile focuses on **fast feedback**, **continuous improvement**, and **flexibility**.

## 3. Key Differences: Agile vs Linear (Waterfall)

| Aspect            | Waterfall      | Agile           |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Planning          | Heavy upfront  | Minimal upfront |
| Change Handling   | Difficult      | Built-in        |
| Customer Feedback | Late           | Continuous      |
| Delivery          | End of project | Every iteration |
| Risk              | High           | Reduced early   |

---

## 4. Benefits of Agile Development

1. **Easy Adaptation to Change**
2. **Lower Technical Debt**

   * Maintenance tasks handled in each sprint.
3. **Risk Reduction**

   * Early testing and feedback.
4. **Higher Quality**

   * Small features perfected before release.
5. **Predictable Delivery**

   * Short iterations with visible progress.
6. **Better Communication**

   * Daily interaction between team and client.

---

## 5. Agile Is Iterative by Nature

1. Work starts **immediately**
2. Deliver **imperfect but usable** software early
3. Improve through repeated iterations
4. Final product evolves based on real feedback

---

## 6. Scrum Framework (Agile Implementation)

### 6.1 Scrum Roles

   * Shields team from external interference
   * Ensures rules are followed

3. **Development Team**

   * 5–9 members
   * Self-organizing
   * Cross-functional
   * Responsible for development and delivery

---

### 6.2 Scrum Artifacts

1. **User Stories**

   * Describe *what* the system does (not how).

2. **Product Backlog**

   * All approved user stories.

3. **Release Backlog**

   * Stories planned for a release.

4. **Sprint Backlog**

   * Stories selected for the sprint.

5. **Burndown Chart**

   * Visual progress tracking.

6. **Block List**

   * Obstacles affecting progress.

---

### 6.3 Scrum Ceremonies

1. **Sprint Planning**
2. **Daily Scrum**

   * 15 minutes
3. **Sprint Review**

   * 2–4 hours
4. **Sprint Retrospective**

   * Process improvement

---

## 7. Scrum Process Flow

1. Product Owner creates backlog
2. Sprint planning → sprint backlog
3. Sprint (2–4 weeks)
4. Daily scrums
5. Sprint review
6. Repeat until:

   * Budget ends
   * Deadline reached
   * Product owner satisfied

---

## 8. Extreme Programming (XP)

### 8.1 Purpose
